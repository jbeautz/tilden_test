# Raspberry Pi Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ Working Features

### Display
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working
- 5" 800x480 DSI display showing graphics
- Soil Monitor GUI with tree rings visualization
- Using pygame dummy driver with framebuffer output
- Resolution: 800x480

### Sensors
- **BME680**: ‚úÖ Working
  - I2C address: 0x77
  - Reading temperature, humidity, pressure
  
- **GPS**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardware working, needs permission fix
  - Hardware confirmed working (NMEA data detected)
  - Permission fix script created: `fix_gps_permissions.sh`
  - **Action needed**: Run fix script and reboot

### Data Logging
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working
- CSV files created with timestamps
- Recording toggles with SPACE key
- Files: `rake_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`

### User Input
- **Keyboard**: ‚úÖ Working
  - SPACE key: Toggle recording
  - ESC key: Quit application
  
- **Touch Screen**: ‚ùå Not working
  - Issue: pygame dummy driver doesn't support touch input
  - Workaround: Use SPACE key on connected keyboard
  - Alternative: Could try running from Pi console instead of SSH

## üöÄ How to Run

### Start the Application
```bash
cd ~/tilden_test/rake_test
./start_forest_rings.sh
```

### Controls
- **SPACE**: Start/Stop recording
- **ESC**: Quit application

### View Logs
```bash
# List all log files
ls -lt rake_log_*.csv

# View latest log
tail rake_log_*.csv | tail -20

# Clean up old logs
./cleanup_logs.sh
```

## üîß Known Issues & Fixes

### 1. GPS Permission Denied
**Symptom**: "Permission denied: /dev/serial0"

**Fix**:
```bash
./fix_gps_permissions.sh
sudo reboot
```

### 2. Touch Screen Not Working
**Symptom**: Touching screen doesn't toggle recording

**Workaround**: Use SPACE key on keyboard instead

**Potential Fix**: Run from Pi console (not SSH):
- Connect keyboard/mouse directly to Pi
- Login at console (Ctrl+Alt+F1)
- Run application from there

### 3. Display Using Dummy Driver
**Status**: Not a problem - display works despite using "dummy" driver

The framebuffer is being written to directly, so graphics appear correctly.

## üìã Next Steps (Optional)

### To Enable Touch Input
1. **Option 1**: Use SPACE key (current workaround)
2. **Option 2**: Run from Pi console instead of SSH
3. **Option 3**: Install `evtest` and identify touch device:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install evtest
   # Then modify touch_handler.py with correct device
   ```

### To Improve Performance
- Display already at 30 FPS, performs well
- Sensors reading at appropriate intervals
- No performance issues detected

## üéØ Deployment Checklist

- [x] BME680 sensor working
- [x] Display showing GUI
- [x] Data logging functional
- [x] Keyboard input working
- [x] Tree rings visualization
- [ ] GPS permissions (needs reboot after fix)
- [ ] Touch input (use SPACE key instead)

## üìÅ Important Files

- `main.py` - Main application
- `display_forest_rings.py` - GUI with tree rings
- `sensor.py` - BME680 sensor interface
- `gps.py` - GPS module interface
- `logger.py` - CSV data logging
- `start_forest_rings.sh` - Startup script
- `fix_gps_permissions.sh` - GPS permission fix
- `cleanup_logs.sh` - Delete old log files

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### No Display Output
```bash
# Check framebuffer
ls -la /dev/fb0

# Check if process is running
ps aux | grep python
```

### Sensor Not Reading
```bash
# Check I2C
i2cdetect -y 1

# Should show device at 0x77
```

### GPS Not Working
```bash
# Check UART
ls -la /dev/serial0

# Check raw data
cat /dev/serial0

# Should see NMEA sentences
```

## ‚ú® Success!

The Soil Monitor is deployed and functional on the Raspberry Pi! 

- Beautiful tree ring visualization shows sensor data over time
- Data is being logged to CSV files
- System runs automatically with `./start_forest_rings.sh`
- Use SPACE key to start/stop recording

**Enjoy monitoring your soil conditions!** üå±
